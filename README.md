## Introduction
This is  my submission for the Classic Arcade Game Clone

## Objective
Cross the road to the water without getting hit by the bugs.  Gather objects along the way to increase your score!

## Gameplay
The player is controlled with the arrow keys.  You cannot move off the screen.  Once you reach the water, you will return to the starting point.

## Scoring
You receive 1000 points each time you reach the water.  Objects are worth a variety of additional points.  Your high score is displayed in the top right of the screen - see how high you can get!
