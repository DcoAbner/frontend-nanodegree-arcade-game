## Introduction
This is  my submission for the Classic Arcade Game Clone

## How to Run the Game
This is an HTML-5 canvas and JavaScript game.  Download the files from Github into a local folder, and load index.html into any modern browser and the game will automatically start.

## How To Play the Game
Cross the road to the water without getting hit by the bugs.  Gather objects along the way to increase your score!

#### Gameplay
The player is controlled with the arrow keys.  You cannot move off the screen.  Once you reach the water, you will return to the starting point.

#### Scoring
You receive 1000 points each time you reach the water.  Gems will periodically appear that are worth a variety of additional points.  Your high score is displayed in the top right of the screen - see how high you can get!

#### Game Over
The game ends when you are hit by a bug.  Your score will reset to zero and your player's position will be placed back on the bottom row.
